# Testing LoomAgent

How `loom` is tested: its own suite, its gated build of real output, and prompts run through
[Craft](https://github.com/riteshpakala/Craft) on a Mac with Craft's own local model, each logged below verbatim with
what came out. A prompt is run as a person would type it, in a project folder, with `$` naming the agent; nothing is
edited between the prompt and the screenshots. A test that needs a server uses mock backend responses, never a live
service.

## The suite

```
swift test                                  # the record, the schema, the lines, the files, a call through the roster
LOOM_BUILD=1 swift test --filter LoomBuildTests   # the output built for real (gated, minutes)
```

## Prompts run on this Mac

Setup: MacBook Pro M4 Max (128 GB), macOS 27, Xcode 27.1, Craft built from `main`, the model Craft loads
(`rao-studios/Qwen3-Coder-Next-REAP-48B-A3B-mlx-4bit`), permission mode bypass, the agent installed from this repository
with `craft agents add`.

### 1. Hearth's social screens over HearthKit's types (the journey's seventh prompt)

*2026-11-01 · Qwen3-Coder-Next-REAP-48B-A3B-mlx-4bit · 471 s*

**The prompt**, verbatim:

```text
Give Hearth its social screens with $loom, in Loom's look with the colours from the asset catalog, over HearthKit's Post, Comment, User and Community: post cards in a feed with votes, saves and sharing; a post's page with its threaded comments and replies; compose with the Markdown toolbar; profiles and community pages.
```

**The call the model wrote** to `loom`:

```json
{
  "colors": "assets",
  "features": [
    "vote",
    "save",
    "share",
    "reply",

    "user: User name=name display=display_name avatar=avatar bio=bio",

    "compose",
    "reply",
    "profile",
    "community",
    "search"
  ],
  "style": "loom"
}
```

**What `loom` wrote** (44 files): `Shared/Views/Social/SocialProtocols.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialValue.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialFormat.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialContext.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialStyle.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialActions.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialPhase.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialMenu.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialThread.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/SocialSwipe.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/AvatarView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/BannerView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/CensorView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/MarkdownBodyView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/LinkPreviewView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/MediaGalleryView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/ContentStateView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/ContentMenuView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/ContentHeaderView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/ContentFooterView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/PostCardView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/CommentCardView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/CommentThreadView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/PostPageView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/FeedHeaderView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/FeedView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/FeedSplitView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/MarkdownEditorView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/ComposeView.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/ReplyView.swift` …

**What the model changed itself**: `Shared/Views/Social/Conformances/AppSocial.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/Conformances/Post+Post.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/Conformances/Comment+Comment.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/Conformances/User+User.swift`, `Shared/Views/Social/Conformances/Community+Community.swift`

**Verified by hand**:
- The macOS scheme builds with the kit and its conformances; the screens are drawn on the app's pages in later entries.

![The turn: one call to loom, the files it wrote, and the imports the model added by hand](Docs/Testing/1-7-loom.png)
*The turn: one call to loom, the files it wrote, and the imports the model added by hand*

**Notes**:
- The mappings read HearthKit's fields as they are spelled there (`created_at`, `comment_count`: HearthKit was made by a network release that kept the API's snake_case).
- The conformances did not build until the model imported HearthKit into five files: the line gave no `imports`, and loom did not know where Post was declared.
- Fixed in the next release: loom reads the app's own types, imports a mapped type's local package with a note, writes each path in the type's spelling (`created_at` read as `createdAt` where the type says so), and refuses a field the type does not have, listing the ones it has.

## Conformance on Hearth

Level 1 of the regime: the call a model should write, sent straight to the installed runner over its wire
(granite-agent/1) with no model, on a copy of Hearth as the journey left it (services, mock data and loom's views
made), then checked by building, testing and screenshotting the app. A pass here means the agent can produce the
result deterministically; whether Craft's model writes this call is tested by the prompts above.

### The kit with asset colours, before and after the catalog has them

*2026-11-01 · straight to the runner, no model*

**The call**:

```json
{
  "colors": "assets"
}
```

**Checks**:
- Before the colour sets existed, every word drew clear (left out of the catalog): fixed by falling back to the system's colours with a note
- After `assets` wrote the six colors/… sets, the views read them: warm pages and ink in light and dark

![Asset colours the catalog did not have: avatars and no text](Docs/Testing/l1-l1-feed-light.png)

## Combinations

Level 3 of the regime (`TESTING-REGIME.md`): one prompt chaining agents, run through Craft on a local model, on Margin
(a book-club app made from nothing). The same section is in LoomAgent's and GraniteAgent's TESTING.md, since both are in
every combination. Rows are oldest first, so the fixes read as a before/after line; each run's entry follows the table.

Columns: the sketch and the window; wall seconds, and how many of them were spent inside agents; seconds to the first
agent call; agent calls made / refused / refused then corrected; files the model wrote by hand; the peak prompt
against the window (it can pass 100%: the bound is checked between rounds, and one generation can overrun it) and
how many times the turn made room; how it stopped; the macOS build. The model, the compactions and the
auto-compaction checks are in each run's entry.

**Window**: peak 86% of 64k; compactions: atAgentCall 39k→39k, atAgentCall 40k→39k, atAgentCall 42k→42k, inTurn 56k→45k; checks: room before the agents pass · compaction works pass · the breath pass · no thrash pass; 2 re-reads after the first compaction

**Stopped**: loopLimit: out of tool rounds (50)

**Build**: macOS: succeeded

**Notes**:
- First live combination run that builds. The sketch planned a call to each agent (B1); refusals were corrected, not abandoned (B2); compaction made room four times and the window never filled (B3).
- The sketch copied its worked example's toolchain (src/main.rs, cargo build): the model wrote Cargo.toml and installed Rust to pass a cargo build check. Fixed in Craft 3d4bbe1.
- granite dropped a service's events sent as `endpoints`; pages calling `load` were refused until the rounds ran out. Fixed in GraniteAgent d93ad1a (unknown fields refused).

**Stopped**: loopLimit: out of tool rounds (50); one last call offered to `granite`

**Build**: failed
- `error: value of type 'Post' has no member 'author'`
- `error: 'Meta' is not a member type of generic struct 'Swift.Set'`
- `error: '@escaping' only applies to function types`

**Notes**:
- c4's prompt again on the same state (c3g + loom replay). The plan the model read began with "call `granite`", and it wrote 26 page files by hand instead; granite was called only when the spent budget offered its last call (B4 working), and refused: FeedService had no work. Fixed in Craft 49ccea1 (a hand edit before a required agent answers is told once) and GraniteAgent 52e1f23 (the refusal says how to give the service its work).
- Room was made four times inside the turn (60k→44k, 56k→37k, 56k→44k, 57k→43k); the window never filled.

- `FeedPage+Actions.swift:8:19: error: cannot find 'loadFeed' in scope (granite's output, replayed)`

**Notes**:
- granite was called first (217 s) and made the Feed, Post and Profile pages and the navigation; its one refusal (a page named like MarginKit's PostPage) was corrected at once. Then the model hand-edited services and pages, and the build failed on its own ModalService relay.
- Replayed alone, granite's own output did not build either: it had accepted actions calling `loadFeed(…)` and `modals.set(…)`, which nothing declares. Fixed in GraniteAgent 4c2e728 and 357985f: an action reaching what the page cannot see is refused, naming the fix ("FeedService has no work yet: give it `load` first … then call `feed.load(…)`").
